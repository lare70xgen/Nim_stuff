inotifywait 3.22.1.0
Wait for a particular event on a file or set of files.
Usage: inotifywait [ options ] file1 [ file2 ] [ file3 ] [ ... ]
Options:
        -h|--help       Show this help text.
        @<file>         Exclude the specified file from being watched.
        --exclude <pattern>
                        Exclude all events on files matching the
                        extended regular expression <pattern>.
                        Only the last --exclude option will be
                        taken into consideration.
        --excludei <pattern>
                        Like --exclude but case insensitive.
        --include <pattern>
                        Exclude all events on files except the ones
                        matching the extended regular expression
                        <pattern>.
        --includei <pattern>
                        Like --include but case insensitive.
        -m|--monitor    Keep listening for events forever or until --timeout expires.
                        Without this option, inotifywait will exit after one event is received.
        -d|--daemon     Same as --monitor, except run in the background
                        logging events to a file specified by --outfile.
                        Implies --syslog.
        -P|--no-dereference
                        Do not follow symlinks.
        -r|--recursive  Watch directories recursively.
        --fromfile <file>
                        Read files to watch from <file> or `-' for stdin.
        -o|--outfile <file>
                        Print events to <file> rather than stdout.
        -s|--syslog     Send errors to syslog rather than stderr.
        -q|--quiet      Print less (only print events).
        -qq             Print nothing (not even events).
        --format <fmt>  Print using a specified printf-like format
                        string; read the man page for more details.
        --no-newline    Don't print newline symbol after
                        --format string.
        --timefmt <fmt> strftime-compatible format string for use with
                        %T in --format string.
        -c|--csv        Print events in CSV format.
        -t|--timeout <seconds>
                        When listening for a single event, time out after
                        waiting for an event for <seconds> seconds.
                        If <seconds> is zero, inotifywait will never time out.
        -e|--event <event1> [ -e|--event <event2> ... ]
                Listen for specific event(s).  If omitted, all events are
                listened for.

Exit status:
        0  -  An event you asked to watch for was received.
        1  -  An event you did not ask to watch for was received
              (usually delete_self or unmount), or some error occurred.
        2  -  The --timeout option was given and no events occurred
              in the specified interval of time.
